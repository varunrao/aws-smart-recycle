Follow the steps below to setup and configure a Raspberry Pi 4 with a SenseHat and Camera for the Smart Recycle Kit

## Setting up a Raspberry Pi for the first time

If you are setting up a Raspberry Pi for the first time, you must follow all of these steps. Otherwise, you can skip to step 9. However, we recommend that you re-image your Raspberry Pi and follow these instructions.

1. Download and install an SD card formatter such as [SD Memory Card Formatter](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/index.html) or [PiBakery](http://www.pibakery.org/download.html). Insert the SD card into your computer. Start the program and choose the drive where you have inserted your SD card. You can perform a quick format of the SD card.

1. Download the [Raspbian Buster](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/images/raspbian-2020-02-14/) operating system as a zip file.

1. Using an SD card-writing tool (such as [Etcher](https://etcher.io/)), follow the tool's instructions to flash the downloaded zip file onto the SD card. Because the operating system image is large, this step might take some time. Eject your SD card from your computer, and insert the microSD card into your Raspberry Pi.

1. For the first boot, we recommend that you connect the Raspberry Pi to a monitor (through HDMI), a keyboard, and a mouse. Next, connect your Pi to a USB-C power source and the Raspbian operating system should start up.
